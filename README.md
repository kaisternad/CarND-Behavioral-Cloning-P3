This repository contains the files for the Udacity Behavioral Cloning Project.

It is a working model that is based on the NVIDIA deep learning architecture as outlined [here](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/)

In order to train the model, the images go through an augmentation pipeline. Also, additional training data was recorded (no recovery data, just normal laps).
